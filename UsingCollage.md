## Tips on using the Collage graphical editing tools ##

  * While you are using a Collage tool that selects or creates shapes in the graphical layers, regular text editing in the code editor is disabled. To re-enable text editing, click the "Normal text editing" button at the left end of the toolbar.
  * The Undo, Redo and Delete operations can be accessed via the Edit menu or by their usual keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+Y, Del).
  * The Properties and Collage Layers views can be easily accessed by using the two buttons at the right-hand side of the toolbar.
  * To disable the Collage toolbar and layers completely, right-click in the left-hand ruler and uncheck "Show Collage". To enable Collage again, right-click in the left-hand ruler and check "Show Collage". (See screenshot at right.)

## Tips on using the Collage Layers view ##

  * The layer highlighted in **bold** is the "active" (currently editable) layer.
    * When you create new shapes, they are added to the active layer. Only shapes in the active layer can be selected and edited.
    * A layer cannot be deleted or made invisible while it is active.
    * To make a different layer active, double-click on it.
  * There's one set of layers for the entire workspace; layers can contain shapes from multiple files. You might find it convenient to think of a layer as a way to organize graphical annotations and files relevant to a task (e.g., planning notes for an enhancement request, or a debugging session, or a code review...)
  * As in graphical editing tools like Adobe Photoshop and GIMP, layers are ordered from top to bottom in the layers view. In other words, if shapes from two layers overlap, the shape from the layer that is higher in the list will be on top.
  * To move layers up or down in the layer stack, select them and drag them to their new position.
  * To rename a layer, select it, then click on its name again to edit. (It's like renaming a file in Windows.)
  * The "eye" icon next to a layer indicates that it is currently visible. You can hide or show a layer by using the "show/hide" tool in the view toolbar. You can also toggle a layer's visibility by clicking on its eye icon (or, for hidden layers, on the blank space where the eye would be.)
  * The Undo, Redo and Delete operations can be accessed via the Edit menu or by their usual keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+Y, Del).
